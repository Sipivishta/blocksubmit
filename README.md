> 🔐 Secure, immutable, and role-based assignment submission system using blockchain principles

---

## 📌 Overview

**BlockSubmit** is a blockchain-inspired system that ensures:

- ✔️ Tamper-proof assignment submissions  
- ✔️ Verifiable timestamps  
- ✔️ Role-based access (Student / Teacher)  
- ✔️ Course-based filtering  
- ✔️ Version tracking for submissions  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional systems suffer from:

- ❌ File modification after submission  
- ❌ No proof of submission time  
- ❌ No version tracking  
- ❌ No transparency  

---

## 💡 Solution

BlockSubmit solves this using:

- 🔐 SHA-256 hashing  
- ⛓️ Blockchain-style linked records  
- 🕒 Immutable timestamps  
- 🔄 Version tracking  
- 👥 Role-based authentication  
- 📚 Course-based access control  

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🔐 Secure Login & Signup system  
- 👥 Role-based dashboards (Student / Teacher)  
- 📂 Assignment Upload with version tracking  
- 🔍 File Verification (Original / Updated / Invalid)  
- ⛓️ Blockchain record storage  
- 🌐 Multi-node system (Node1 & Node2)  
- 🎨 Modern Dark UI

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Student uploads assignment  
2. File is hashed using SHA-256  
3. Block is created with:
   - Student ID  
   - Course ID  
   - Version  
   - File Hash  
   - Timestamp  
   - Previous Hash  
4. Block is stored in blockchain  
5. Teacher verifies file integrity

## 🔍 Verification Logic

| Case | Result |
|------|--------|
| Same file | ✅ Original |
| Modified file | ⚠️ Updated |
| Wrong file | ❌ Invalid |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Flask)  
- HTML + CSS (Dark UI)  
- SHA-256 (hashlib)  
- REST APIs  
- JSON storage
